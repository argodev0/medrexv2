# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced RBAC System implements a sophisticated nine-role hierarchical access control system with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) integration for the Medrex V2.0 platform. This system enforces complex clinical governance rules through State-Based Endorsement (SBE) policies and provides granular permission management using X.509 certificate attributes and Node Organizational Units (NodeOUs).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare system administrator, I want a nine-role hierarchical RBAC system, so that access control reflects the complex organizational structure and clinical governance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL implement nine distinct user roles with hierarchical permissions
2. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL map each role to specific NodeOU classifications in Hyperledger Fabric
3. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL extract role information from X.509 certificate attributes
4. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL enforce role-based permissions for all system resources
5. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL support role inheritance and delegation where clinically appropriate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a clinical supervisor, I want State-Based Endorsement policies for trainee activities, so that clinical governance rules are automatically enforced by the blockchain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MD/MS student submits CPOE order, THE SBE_Policy SHALL require consulting physician co-signature
2. WHEN MBBS student accesses patient data, THE SBE_Policy SHALL restrict access to de-identified training data only
3. THE SBE_Policy SHALL validate supervisor credentials before allowing co-signature
4. THE SBE_Policy SHALL enforce time-based restrictions on trainee activities
5. THE SBE_Policy SHALL maintain immutable records of all supervision activities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want attribute-based access control, so that permissions are granted based on dynamic context and attributes rather than static roles alone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ABAC_Engine SHALL evaluate user attributes from X.509 certificates for access decisions
2. THE ABAC_Engine SHALL consider contextual factors such as time, location, and patient assignment
3. THE ABAC_Engine SHALL enforce attribute-based restrictions on data access
4. THE ABAC_Engine SHALL support complex policy expressions combining multiple attributes
5. THE ABAC_Engine SHALL log all attribute-based access decisions for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want certificate attribute management, so that user roles and permissions are cryptographically bound to their digital identities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Certificate_Attribute_Manager SHALL embed role attributes in X.509 enrollment certificates
2. THE Certificate_Attribute_Manager SHALL support custom attributes for clinical specialties and assignments
3. THE Certificate_Attribute_Manager SHALL validate attribute integrity during certificate verification
4. THE Certificate_Attribute_Manager SHALL support attribute updates through certificate renewal
5. THE Certificate_Attribute_Manager SHALL integrate with Fabric CA for attribute management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a consulting physician, I want automated supervision workflows, so that trainee activities are properly supervised without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Supervision_Workflow SHALL automatically identify activities requiring supervision
2. THE Supervision_Workflow SHALL route supervision requests to appropriate supervisors
3. THE Supervision_Workflow SHALL enforce supervision timeouts and escalation procedures
4. THE Supervision_Workflow SHALL maintain supervision history for compliance reporting
5. THE Supervision_Workflow SHALL support emergency override procedures with enhanced logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want appropriate access to learning resources, so that I can develop clinical skills while maintaining patient safety and privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MBBS student requests data access, THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL provide de-identified training datasets
2. WHEN MD/MS student performs clinical activities, THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL require appropriate supervision
3. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL restrict student access to assigned patients and supervisors only
4. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL prevent students from accessing administrative or financial functions
5. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL track all student activities for educational assessment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a clinical staff member, I want role-specific access controls, so that I can perform my duties efficiently while maintaining security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL grant nursing staff access to ward-specific patient data
2. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL allow lab technicians access to relevant orders and results
3. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL provide receptionists access to demographics and scheduling functions
4. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL enable clinical specialists to access specialty-specific data
5. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL prevent cross-role access to unauthorized functions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want comprehensive RBAC testing, so that access control policies are validated and compliance is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL provide automated testing for all role-permission combinations
2. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL validate SBE policy enforcement through integration tests
3. THE Advanced_RBAC_System SHALL test attribute-based access control scenarios
