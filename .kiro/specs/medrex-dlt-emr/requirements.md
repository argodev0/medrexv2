# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Medrex DLT EMR is a comprehensive Electronic Medical Records system built on a hybrid distributed ledger architecture using Hyperledger Fabric. The system provides secure, compliant, and scalable healthcare data management with strict HIPAA/GDPR compliance, role-based access control, and immutable audit trails while keeping PHI off-chain for privacy protection.

- **PHI**: Protected Health Information stored off-chain in encrypted PostgreSQL
- **AccessPolicy_Chaincode**: Smart contract managing role-based access control policies
- **AuditLog_Chaincode**: Smart contract maintaining immutable audit trails
- **IAM_Service**: Identity and Access Management microservice
- **API_Gateway**: Single entry point service for all client requests
- **Clinical_Notes_Service**: Microservice managing off-chain PHI data
- **Scheduling_Service**: Microservice handling appointment and resource management
- **Mobile_Workflow_Service**: Microservice optimized for mobile application workflows
- **MSP**: Membership Service Provider managing organizational identities
- **PRE**: Proxy Re-Encryption for secure key management
- **HSM**: Hardware Security Module for cryptographic key protection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare system administrator, I want a secure DLT-based EMR infrastructure, so that patient data is protected while maintaining regulatory compliance and audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Medrex_System SHALL deploy a fault-tolerant HF_Network with minimum three ordering nodes using Raft consensus

3. THE Medrex_System SHALL deploy dedicated Fabric CAs for each organization with X.509 certificate management
4. THE Medrex_System SHALL integrate with HSM service for cryptographic key management using PRE principles
5. THE Medrex_System SHALL store PHI exclusively off-chain in 256-bit AES encrypted PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want role-based access control, so that users can only access data appropriate to their role and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AccessPolicy_Chaincode SHALL enforce RBAC matrix with nine distinct user roles
2. WHEN a user requests PHI access, THE AccessPolicy_Chaincode SHALL verify user role against resource access policy
3. THE AccessPolicy_Chaincode SHALL extract user role from authenticated X.509 certificate MSP attributes
4. WHERE access is authorized, THE AccessPolicy_Chaincode SHALL release PRE re-encryption tokens for off-chain PHI access
5. THE Medrex_System SHALL deny access IF user role does not match required permissions for requested resource

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want immutable audit trails, so that all system activities are tracked for regulatory reporting and security monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AuditLog_Chaincode SHALL record every user login and logout event
2. THE AuditLog_Chaincode SHALL log all PHI access attempts with success or failure status
3. THE AuditLog_Chaincode SHALL capture all data modification events with user identity
4. THE AuditLog_Chaincode SHALL record all CPOE entries with cryptographic signatures
5. THE AuditLog_Chaincode SHALL timestamp all entries with non-repudiation guarantees

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want containerized microservices, so that the system is scalable, maintainable, and follows cloud-native principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE IAM_Service SHALL handle user registration and MFA enforcement
2. THE API_Gateway SHALL implement OAuth 2.0/JWT validation and rate limiting
3. THE Clinical_Notes_Service SHALL decrypt PHI only after AccessPolicy_Chaincode authorization
4. THE Scheduling_Service SHALL manage appointment scheduling and resource availability
5. THE Mobile_Workflow_Service SHALL support CPOE and consultant co-sign workflows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want supervised access to patient data, so that I can learn while maintaining patient privacy and safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MBBS student requests access, THE Medrex_System SHALL provide read-only access to de-identified training data
2. WHEN MD/MS student requests CPOE, THE Medrex_System SHALL require consultant co-signature before execution
3. THE Medrex_System SHALL restrict student access to assigned patient charts only
4. THE Medrex_System SHALL prevent students from accessing financial or administrative functions
5. THE Medrex_System SHALL log all student activities for supervision and compliance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a consulting physician, I want full clinical access, so that I can provide comprehensive patient care and supervise trainees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Medrex_System SHALL grant consulting physicians full CRUD access to assigned patient EHRs
2. THE Medrex_System SHALL enable full CPOE capabilities including e-prescribing for consulting physicians
3. THE Medrex_System SHALL provide research data control with PI role permissions
4. THE Medrex_System SHALL allow read access to hospital-level financial data
5. THE Medrex_System SHALL enable department staff management capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a patient, I want secure access to my health information, so that I can manage my care while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Medrex_System SHALL provide patients read access to their own EHR data
2. THE Medrex_System SHALL enable secure communication between patients and providers
3. THE Medrex_System SHALL allow patients to schedule appointments
4. THE Medrex_System SHALL provide payment interface for billing inquiries
5. THE Medrex_System SHALL prevent patient access to administrative or other patients' data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the system meets reliability and security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Medrex_System SHALL achieve minimum 85% unit test coverage across all microservices
2. THE Medrex_System SHALL implement integration tests for HF_Network interactions
